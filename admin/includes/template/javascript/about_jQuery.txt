NOTE:
Zen Cart loads jQuery from the googleapis CDN.  This is usually the fastest and most efficient.

However, if you are working "offline" and not connected to the internet, you may want to put the following 3 jQuery files in this folder.

FILES:
/your_admin_folder/includes/template/javascript/jquery.min.js
/your_admin_folder/includes/template/javascript/jquery-ui.min.js
/your_admin_folder/includes/template/javascript/jquery-ui.min.css

REPEAT: THESE ARE *NOT* NECESSARY for normal daily operation on a live store, since they will load automatically when online.
But for working offline (ie: on the subway on a PC with a test-webserver on laptop) then having these 3 files in the specified folder will be useful.
